About
-----

The package **segment-lidar** is specifically designed for unsupervised instance segmentation of aerial LiDAR data. It brings together the power of Segment-Anything Model (SAM) developed by Meta Research and segment-geospatial package from Open Geospatial Solutions. Whether you're a researcher, developer, or a geospatial enthusiast, segment-lidar opens up new possibilities for automatic processing of aerial LiDAR data and enables further applications. We encourage you to explore our code, contribute to its development and leverage its capabilities for your segmentation tasks.
